# Testing the Supervisor Assignment Feature

This guide explains how to test the supervisor selection and assignment features that have been implemented.

## Supervisor Assignment Features

1. **Selecting a Supervisor When Creating a User**:
   - When adding a new user with the role "موظف" (employee), a supervisor dropdown will appear
   - You can select any user with role "مشرف" (supervisor) or "مدير النظام" (admin)
   - The assigned supervisor will be displayed in the user list

2. **Assigning/Changing Supervisors for Existing Users**:
   - Click the supervisor icon (👤) next to any employee user
   - Select a supervisor from the dropdown
   - Click "تعيين" (Assign) to save the assignment

3. **Viewing Supervisor Assignments**:
   - The supervisor column shows the currently assigned supervisor for each employee
   - Employees without supervisors will show "لا يوجد مشرف" (No supervisor)

## Testing Steps

### Test 1: Create a New Employee with a Supervisor

1. Log in as an admin user
2. Go to the User Management page
3. Click "إضافة مستخدم" (Add User)
4. Fill in the required fields
5. Select "موظف" (employee) as the role
6. Select a supervisor from the dropdown that appears
7. Click "إضافة" (Add) to create the user
8. Verify the new user appears in the list with the correct supervisor assigned

### Test 2: Change a Supervisor Assignment

1. Find an employee user in the list
2. Click the supervisor icon (👤) next to the user
3. Select a different supervisor from the dropdown
4. Click "تعيين" (Assign) to save the change
5. Verify the supervisor name updates in the user list

### Test 3: Verify Supervisor Display

1. Add multiple supervisors and employees
2. Assign different supervisors to different employees
3. Check that the supervisor column correctly shows the assigned supervisor for each employee

## Troubleshooting

If supervisor information isn't displaying correctly:

1. Refresh the page to reload all data
2. Run the refresh-supervisor-display.bat script to check database assignments
3. Check the console logs for any error messages

## Database Verification

To verify supervisor assignments directly in the database:

```sql
SELECT e.full_name as employee, s.full_name as supervisor
FROM employee_supervisors es
JOIN users e ON es.employee_id = e.id
JOIN users s ON es.supervisor_id = s.id;
```

This query will show all employee-supervisor pairs currently in the system.
